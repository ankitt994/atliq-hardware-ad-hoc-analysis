## üìå Domain: Consumer Goods  
**Function:** Executive Management

## üìä Project Overview

**Atliq Hardwares** (an imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India, with a strong presence in international markets. However, their management team lacked access to quick, data-driven insights to make smart decisions.

As part of their expansion plan, the company initiated a **SQL Challenge** to hire junior data analysts with both **technical and soft skills**. I participated in this challenge and completed the full data pipeline from SQL analysis to dashboarding and storytelling.
